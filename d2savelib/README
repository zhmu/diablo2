This is my attempt to write an usuable library for interfacing with Diablo2
1.09/1.10+ saved games. It was designed to be used from my new Diablo2 item
website, so that I could easily import characters without having to figure out
manually which items they exactly had. 

The library seems to work well; it's capable of reading all D2S file I have,
from any version. Futhermore, it can also read D2I/D2X files as well.

However, once the library and site were done, I decided that my Diablo2 days
were finally over - so I never properly integrated them. As I feel it's a
shame to just let these things be unused, I'm releasing this code using
the GPLv2 license.
