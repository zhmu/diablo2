From 2001 to about 2004, I was a terrible Diablo2 addict. In particular items,
I really collected those; ended up owning 95% of all items in Diablo, with very
rare items such as Tal Rasha's Guardianship twice ... :-) However, I lost all
my saved games in a crash and never really got the hang of Diablo2 back :S

Anyway, in order to keep a nice overview, I created a website for this. It is
complete, and has all items for 1.09 (which is the last Diablo I seriously
played, I hate 1.10/1.11!!!). You can create accounts for people and have them
select their stuff, which can be searched, looked up etc.

A control panel is also there, to add new item types and uniques. Should anyone
add all 1.11 items too, please let me know so I can refer to your site.

You will need to edit db_config.php with your database information, the raw SQL
dump can be found in diablo2.sql. lib.php contains an email adress which will
be mailed if a database query goes wrong; please change that as well.

The default passwords are:

Control panel: username 'admin', password 'admin'
Site: username 'user', password 'user'

This stuff is released under the GPL, so feel free to mess with it! But 
please, credit me (Rink Springer, mail@rink.nu) if you use this ... it was so
much work making a database of all these items!
